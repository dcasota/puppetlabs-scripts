Puppet is a open source software configuration management and deployment tool. It solves system administrators' problems working with multiple servers by automating the IT infrastructure, and ensuring that all systems are configured to a desired and predictable state.

Lately, in 2022 it has been acquired by Perforce - a leading provider of highly scalable development and DevOps solutions.
The goal of a new tools for Kubernetes and cloud native apps resulted already in a market consolidation of independent configuration management vendors , eg. Chef has been Acquired by Progress, Ansible has been bought by IBM, and Saltstack has been bought by VMware in 2020.  The focus on making data center and cloud infrastructure easily consumable and facing the multi-cloud adoption challenges, the competitor Hashicorp gained between 2015 until 2022 more traction with their products Terraform, Packer, Vaults, etc. than Puppet did before.
